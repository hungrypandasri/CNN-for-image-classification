    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will follow the below steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. First load and normalize the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n",
    "2. Next, define your CNN model, loss function and optimizer.\n",
    "3. Finally, once you have defined everything correctly, you can begin training your model.\n",
    "4. For evaluation, you will need to test the model on test data and report your test accuracy.\n",
    "5. Plot the model train and validation: loss and accuracy curves\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please referto the tutorial from PyTorch's official documentation: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html to get familiar with PyTorch, especially the data loading part. If you are new to PyTorch, it is recommended to follow the structure in this tutorial to build your model, loss function and training function. For this HW, $20$ out of $25$ points are graded on your code and report. And remaining $05$ points on the performance of your model. Tentative cutoffs for test accuracy:\n",
    "1. $>$ $90\\%$: $5$ points ($+10$ bonus points)\n",
    "2. $>$ $85\\%$: $5$ points ($+5$ bonus points)\n",
    "3. $>$ $80\\%$: $5$ points\n",
    "4. $>$ $75\\%$: $3$ points\n",
    "5. $â‰¤$ $75\\%$: $0$ points\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "1. The below starter notebook follows the official PyTorch Documentation. You are free to make any changes to the sample starter notebook provided below.\n",
    "2. You are recommended to use GPU. If you are training on GPU, please transfer your data and model to GPU Device: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#training-on-gpu)"
